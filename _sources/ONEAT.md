### üöÄ Architecture Overview

Oneat‚Äôs core network, **DenseVollNet**, processes short 4D image crops by treating **time frames as input channels** and applying **only spatial convolutions (Z, Y, X)**:

- **Input:**  
  Patches of size `(Z, Y, X)` with **T timepoints folded as C = T channels** (shape `(Z, Y, X, T)`).

- **DenseVollNet Backbone:**  
  1. **Initial 3D Conv**  
     - `Conv3D` with `startfilter` filters, kernel `(k_z, k_y, k_x)` (e.g. `7√ó7√ó7`), `padding='same'`  
     - **BatchNorm ‚Üí ReLU**  
  2. **Three Dense Block Stages**  
     - Each stage *i* has `depth_i` layers:  
       - **Bottleneck**: `Conv3D(1√ó1√ó1)`, reducing channels (`4¬∑F`)  
       - **Feature**:    `Conv3D(mid_kernel, mid_kernel, mid_kernel)`, growth rate `F`  
       - **Concat** the new features with previous tensor  
     - **Transition layers** between stages (except after the last):  
       - `Conv3D(1√ó1√ó1)` to compress channels (`reduction` factor)  
       - `MaxPool3D(2√ó2√ó2)` to downsample spatial dims  
         - **Downsampling factor per pool:** 2  
         - **Total downsampling factor:** 4 (after two pools), e.g. `(8,64,64) ‚Üí (2,16,16)`  
  3. **BN ‚Üí ReLU** after final dense block

- **Fully-Convolutional Head:**  
  - A **single large `Conv3D`** (kernel `mid_kernel¬≥`, padding='valid') replaces FC layers, outputting `categories + nboxes¬∑box_vector` channels.  
    - Kernel size = `(Z/4, Y/4, X/4)` = `(2,16,16)` for input `(8,64,64)` and `last_conv_factor=4`.  
    - This **collapses** the spatial map to `1√ó1√ó1` per channel.  
  - **Split** these channels into:  
    - **Classification map** (`categories` channels) ‚Üí Softmax  
    - **Regression map** (`nboxes¬∑box_vector` channels) ‚Üí Sigmoid  
  - **Concat** classification & regression outputs.

This design lets Oneat scan any `(Z, Y, X)` volume with **T** frames in one pass, yielding per-voxel mitosis predictions.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Oneat Mitosis Detector

- **Input crops:** `64√ó64√ó8` voxels over `T` timepoints (folded into channels).  
- **Training samples:**  
  - **Positive:** Napari-clicked mitotic events  
  - **Negative:** Random non-dividing crops  
- **Loss:** Binary cross-entropy

After training, Oneat predicts mitosis coordinates `(t, z, y, x)` in whole 4D stacks, which the **TrackMate-Oneat** plugin uses to:

1. **Insert trajectory branches** at predicted mitoses  
2. **Link daughter cells** within a 16.5‚ÄØ¬µm radius (Jaqaman linker)  
3. **Optionally apply MARI** to enforce perpendicular daughter positioning, reducing false positives

**Performance:**  
Integrating Oneat boosts the precision from 0.1 to 0.86 (with MARI) vs. native TrackMate, with a false discovery rate of 0.14 compared to 0.9 of native TrackMate. TrackMate-Oneat extension uses the same track linking algorithm as TrackMate but with a biologically prior information of the locations of mitotic mother cells and it is only desinged to boost the track linking/Branch Correctness index, the mother cells for which both the daughter cells can not be linked are corrected at a later stage to be classified as a mitotic trajectory.
