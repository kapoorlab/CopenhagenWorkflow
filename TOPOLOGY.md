### üß† Topological Features: H‚ÇÄ and H‚ÇÅ with Filtration Scale

#### **Filtration and Thresholds**
- In persistent homology, we examine how the topology of a point cloud **evolves** as we grow a **distance threshold** (filtration scale).
- At each threshold value `Œµ`, we:
  - Connect points whose pairwise distance ‚â§ `Œµ`.
  - Form edges, triangles, and higher simplices.
  - Track how topological features (like components and loops) **appear and disappear**.

---

### üîπ **H‚ÇÄ: Connected Components**
- **Birth**: A point enters as a new component when the filtration begins (`Œµ ‚âà 0`).
- **Death**: A component **dies** when it **merges** with another at some threshold `Œµ = d`, where the inter-point distance is `d`.

> **Interpretation**: The longer a component survives before merging, the more isolated it was ‚Äî indicating **cell sparsity** or **fragmented regions**.

---

### üî∏ **H‚ÇÅ: Loops (1-dimensional holes)**
- **Birth**: A loop is **born** when a cycle forms ‚Äî typically as **edges** close a ring structure at some scale `Œµ = b`.
- **Death**: The loop **dies** when a **2D triangle fills it in** ‚Äî i.e., enough nearby points collapse the hole at scale `Œµ = d`.

> **Interpretation**: The persistence `(d ‚àí b)` of a loop quantifies how long that **cavity existed** before being filled in.  
> Long-lived loops indicate **structurally meaningful gaps**, short-lived ones are likely **noise**.

---

### üïì Timepoint-Specific Meaning
- At each timepoint, we compute persistent homology **on that frame‚Äôs point cloud**, using a growing threshold `Œµ`.
- The filtration simulates **"growing spheres" around each cell/nucleus**, and tracks **topological events**:
  - When do cells first connect?
  - When do loops emerge and collapse?
  - How consistent are these across time?

### üìà How to Interpret the Persistent Homology Plots

We use persistent homology to capture the **topological structure** of spatial patterns (e.g. nuclei) at each timepoint. The analysis yields several types of plots:

---

#### üü¶ 1. **Barcode Plots (H‚ÇÄ and H‚ÇÅ)**

Each frame has a barcode plot:

- **Top (H‚ÇÄ)**: Connected components  
  - Each horizontal bar = one component (e.g. a nucleus or cluster).
  - **Birth**: when it appears (usually at Œµ = 0).  
  - **Death**: when it merges with another component (as Œµ increases).
  - **Interpretation**:
    - Long H‚ÇÄ bars: isolated points (sparse or outlier cells).
    - Sharp drop-off: tight clustering and quick merging.
    - Final surviving bar: the "giant component" that unifies everything.

- **Bottom (H‚ÇÅ)**: Loops or 1D holes  
  - Each bar = one loop (cycle that forms and fills).
  - **Birth**: when the loop appears (points + edges form a ring).
  - **Death**: when it gets filled in (triangle closure).
  - **Interpretation**:
    - Long-lived loops: biologically meaningful voids or repeated motifs.
    - Many medium-length loops: structured spatial patterning (e.g. checkerboard, rosettes).
    - Sudden changes in bar count or length: topological transitions (e.g. onset of patterning).

---

#### üìä 2. **Loop Persistence Statistics (CSV)**

For each timepoint, we export a CSV containing:

- `birth`, `death`, and `persistence = death - birth` for each loop (H‚ÇÅ).
- These can be analyzed statistically over time:
  - Mean/median persistence.
  - Number of long-lived loops.
  - Spatial regularity (e.g. low variance = repeated motif).
  - Temporal spikes = dynamic changes in patterning.

---

#### üåà 3. **Final Combined KDE Plot (H‚ÇÅ persistence across time)**

This summary plot overlays **persistence distributions across timepoints**:

- Each colored line is the **KDE (kernel density estimate)** of H‚ÇÅ persistence values at a given time bin (e.g. every 50 frames).
- The **x-axis** is persistence (loop lifetime), and **y-axis** is density (relative abundance).
- Colors indicate **time bins** (e.g. early, mid, late).

**How to read this:**

- The shape of the distribution reflects the **pattern regularity**:
  - Sharp peaks: consistent, repeating loop sizes.
  - Broad tails: irregular or noisy loops.
- If the shape stays stable and **only the amplitude increases**, this indicates:
  - The same pattern is **spreading across the tissue**.
  - The **checkerboard or rosette structure** is being replicated spatially.
- A shift in the mode or skewness suggests a **change in the dominant spatial scale** or emergence of new structures.

### üß† Biological Interpretation (Example)

| Observation | Interpretation |
|-------------|----------------|
| H‚ÇÅ bars emerge and lengthen around t ‚âà 40 | Onset of patterning; loops begin forming |
| H‚ÇÅ distributions stabilize in shape by t ‚âà 80 | Pattern has become global and repetitive |
| KDE curves show similar shape with increasing amplitude | Repeating motif (e.g. checkerboard) has propagated |

By combining barcodes, statistics, and density plots, we gain a rich, multi-scale view of how topological structure emerges, stabilizes, and spreads over time in biological tissue.
